Changelog HiFiBerry DSP toolkit
===============================

0.12.3
 - Bugfix set-rew-filters

0.12.2 (20180904)
 - Bugfix in ALSA volume control  (did not work before deploying a new
   profile)
 - Better handling of incorrect write requests

0.12.1 (20180720)

0.11 (20180719)
 - Bugfix: REW filters are working again
 - implemented store and store-filter commands that persist DSP settings 
   to the EEPROM
 - renamed some command to make them more consistent

      after a DSP reset
    * store- commands store settings to the DSP's EEPROM

0.10 (20180719)
 - settings files allow to overwrite parameters in the DSPProfile.
